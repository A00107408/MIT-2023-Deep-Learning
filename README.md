Different models for different problem domains:  

Perceptron : Fully connected layers of neurons  
Recurrent neural network : Data with a temporal component eg: speach, music  
Convolutional neural network : Unsupervised learning, generate unlabeled data, reduce dimensoionality of the problem space, idenify latent variables  
Generative adversarial network : To generate data for training
