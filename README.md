Different models for different problem domains:  

Perceptron : Fully connected layers of neurons  (eg. hand writting detection)  
Recurrent neural network : Data with a temporal component eg: speach, music  
Variational auto encoder : Unsupervised learning (eg. debiasing a data set)  
Convolutional neural network : Images (eg. facial recognition)   
Generative adversarial network : To generate data (eg. for unsupervised learning)    
Reinforcement learning : Gaming  
Graph CNNs : Geomtetric features  
Diffusion models (stable / latent) : Text to image generation, protein folding
Transformers and large language models : Text prediction / translation etc
