# MIT-2023-Deep-Learning    
http://introtodeeplearning.com/  

A collection of Phython scripts resulting from the MIT deep leaning 2024 course.   

Different models for different problem domains:  

Perceptron : Fully connected layers of neurons  
Recurrent neural network : Data with a temporal component eg: speach, music  
Convolutional neural network : Unsupervised learning, generate unlabeled data, reduce dimensoionality of the problem space, idenify latent variables  
Generative adversarial network : To generate data for training
