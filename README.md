Different models for different problem domains:  

Perceptron : Fully connected layers of neurons  
Recurrent neural network : Data with a temporal component eg: speach, music  
Variational auto encoder : Unsupervised learning
Convolutional neural network : Generate unlabeled data 
Generative adversarial network : To generate data for unsupervised learning
